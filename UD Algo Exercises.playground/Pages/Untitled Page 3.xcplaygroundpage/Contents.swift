Goal: solve this problem in < 30 minutes.
Write a function that takes as input two arguments:
1. An array of numbers
2. An integer `k`
and returns the `k` largest values from that array. The order of the elements in the returned array doesnâ€™t matter.

Example
- Input array: `[5, 16, 7, 9, -1, 4, 3, 11, 2]`
- `k`: 3
- Result: `[16, 9, 11]` */

import Foundation
func KlargestElement(array: [Int], K: Int) -> Int {
    
}
print(k)
